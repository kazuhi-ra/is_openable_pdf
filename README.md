## Motivation
@kazuhi-ra/is-openable-pdf is a utility library that determines whether a PDF file can be opened in a standard PDF viewer. It returns true if the file is not password-protected or if the user password is set to the default (an empty string).

In browser environments, JavaScript alone cannot detect password protection on PDF filesâ€”particularly when the user password is an empty string. This library leverages WebAssembly to bypass that limitation and perform accurate checks on PDF accessibility.

## Install

```bash
npm install @kazuhi-ra/is-openable-pdf
```

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { isOpenablePdf } from '@kazuhi-ra/is-openable-pdf';

// Check a File object
const isOpenable = await isOpenablePdf(file);
```

## API

```typescript
isOpenablePdf(file: File | Uint8Array): Promise<boolean>
```
